# Log File Overview 

This file contains simulated login activity for a small organization’s system. It was created as part of my AI + SQL Log Analysis Tool project to practice detecting suspicious user behavior using SQL and generative AI prompts.

---

## Table Name:
Assume the log data is stored in a table called `logs`.

---

## Real-World Use:

This kind of data is used by cybersecurity teams to:

- Identify failed login attempts and brute-force attacks
- Monitor who is accessing the admin panel and when
- Track user login behavior across time
- Investigate IP addresses associated with suspicious activity

## How I’ll Use This Data:

I will use this log file to:
- Write SQL queries manually to detect suspicious patterns
- Create natural language prompts for an AI model like ChatGPT to generate SQL queries
- Compare my queries with AI-generated ones and document the differences

This shows my ability to understand log structure, think like an analyst, and use AI tools for automation and investigation.
