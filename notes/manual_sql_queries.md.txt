# Manual SQL Queries – AI + SQL Log Analysis Tool

This file includes basic SQL queries that I wrote manually to analyze log data. These examples help me understand how to ask important security-related questions using SQL.

## Query 1: Find All Failed Login Attempts in the Last 7 Days

SELECT * FROM logs
WHERE status = 'failed_login'
AND timestamp >= DATE('now', '-7 days')
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

## What This Query Does:

- SELECT * FROM logs: Pulls all data from the logs table
- WHERE status = 'failed_login': Filters only the failed login attempts
- AND timestamp >= DATE('now', '-7 days'): Only shows data from the last 7 days
- ORDER BY timestamp DESC: Sorts the results with the newest event first

## Why This Is Useful in Cybersecurity:

This type of query is often used by security teams to detect signs of a brute-force attack, where someone tries to guess a password by repeatedly failing to log in. If the number of failed logins spikes in a short period, it’s a red flag.
